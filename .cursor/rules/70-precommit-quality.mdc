# Pre-commit & Quality Gates

## Pre-commit hooks

- Use `pre-commit` with hooks:
  - ruff (lint + fix)
  - black (format)
  - mypy (strict)
  - pytest (changed tests only if feasible; otherwise run in CI)

## Local workflow

- Run `ruff`, then `black`, then `mypy`, then `pytest` before committing.

## CI gates

- All of the above must pass; treat warnings as failures.

## Files of interest

- Enforce `src/` layout, `tests/` mirroring, `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621) presence, and `package.json` with Foundry CLI devDependency.
