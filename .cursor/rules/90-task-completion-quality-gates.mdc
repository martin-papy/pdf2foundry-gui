# Task Completion Quality Gates

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before marking any Taskmaster task as `done`, you MUST execute the following quality gates in order:

## Pre-Task Completion Checklist

- **Activate Virtual Environment**: Always activate the project's virtual environment before running any commands:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Run Tests**: Execute the full test suite to ensure no regressions:

  ```bash
  pytest tests/ -v
  ```

- **Run Pre-commit Checks**: Execute all pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

  ```bash
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

- **Fix Any Issues**: If either tests fail or pre-commit checks fail:
  - Fix all identified issues
  - Re-run the failed command until it passes
  - Only proceed once both tests and pre-commit checks pass

## Quality Gate Enforcement

- **NEVER** mark a task as `done` using `set_task_status` or `task-master set-status` without first completing ALL quality gates
- **NEVER** skip quality gates for "minor changes" or "quick fixes"
- **ALWAYS** run quality gates even for documentation-only changes
- **ALWAYS** show the user the results of quality gate execution

## Pre-Release Code Cleanup Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Since we have not yet done our initial release, we do NOT want any backward compatibility or deprecation code:

- **Remove ALL backward compatibility code** - we can break things freely before v1.0
- **Remove ALL deprecated functions, classes, or methods** - clean slate approach
- **Remove ALL unused functions** - keep the codebase lean and focused
- **Clean up ANY legacy code patterns** - modernize everything
- **Remove ANY "TODO: remove in v2.0" style comments** - remove the code now

When implementing any task, actively look for and remove:

- Deprecated imports or functions
- Unused utility functions
- Legacy compatibility shims
- Old API endpoints or methods that are no longer needed
- Any code marked with deprecation warnings

## Command Execution Pattern

When completing any task implementation:

1. **Implement the code changes**
2. **Activate virtual environment**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. **Stage all modified files in the git repository**: only stage the changes, do not commit them
4. **Run tests**: `pytest` (must pass and the coverage MUST be at least 90%)
5. **Run pre-commit**: `pre-commit run --all-files` (must pass)
6. **Fix any issues** and repeat steps 3-5 until both pass
7. **Only then** mark task as done: `task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done`

## Error Handling

- If tests fail: Fix the failing tests before proceeding
- If test coverage is below 90%, add more tests to achieve at least 90% coverage
- If pre-commit fails: Fix all linting, formatting, and other issues before proceeding
- If virtual environment activation fails: Investigate and resolve environment issues
- **Document any persistent issues** in the task using `update_subtask` before marking as done

## Integration with Taskmaster Workflow

This rule integrates with the [Taskmaster development workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster/dev_workflow.mdc) by adding mandatory quality gates to the task completion process.

**Remember**: Quality gates are not optional - they are mandatory steps that ensure code reliability and maintainability.
