# Error Handling & Logging

## Fallbacks

- No bookmarks: use heading heuristic; log a warning summarizing detected chapters/sections.
- Table parse failure/low confidence: rasterize to image; log info for the affected page/region.
- Broken cross-reference: keep plain text; log a warning with source context.
- PDF parse errors: abort gracefully with a clear error.

## Logging

- Use structured logging where practical; include PDF page indices, object ids.
- Summarize at end: number of chapters, sections, images exported, tables parsed vs rasterized, unresolved refs.

## Exit behavior

- Return non-zero exit code on unrecoverable errors; otherwise continue with fallbacks.
